# Student To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, marking as completed, and deleting them. The tasks are persisted using localStorage so they remain even after page reloads. Users can also filter tasks based on their completion status.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Filter tasks based on completion status.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Structure of the app.
- CSS3: Styling the application.
- JavaScript: Provides functionality, such as task addition, completion toggle, deletion, and filtering.

## Usage
## Add a Task:

- Enter a Title and Description (optional) for the task in the input fields.
- Click the Add Task button to add the task to the list.
## Mark a Task as Completed:

- Click the checkbox next to the task to mark it as completed.
- Completed tasks will appear with a strikethrough.
### Edit a Task:

- Click the Edit button next to a task to modify its title or description.
- Save the changes and the task will be updated in the list.
## Delete a Task:

- Click the Delete button next to a task to remove it from the list.

## How It Works
- index.html: Contains the structure of the application (task input, list of tasks, and filter options).
- styles.css: Styles the user interface, providing a clean, user-friendly design.
- app.js: Handles the core functionality:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
